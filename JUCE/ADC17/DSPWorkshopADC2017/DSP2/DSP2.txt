7. Integrate a hard-clipping waveshaper (Distortion.h)
8. Change the waveshaper's transfer curve to hyperbolic tangent and adjust pre- and post gain (Distortion.h)
9. Add a high-pass filter before the waveshaper (Distortion.h)
10. Implement the cabinet simulator (CabSimulator.h, Distortion.h) // Much more efficient to do it in frequency domain instead of using an FIR!
